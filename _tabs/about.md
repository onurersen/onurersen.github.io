In the past, I was quite active on social networks. I had account on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. but now I prefer to concentrate on offline way of  living more. Before moving to the Netherlands, I traveled some for business which gave me the opportunity to discover places, people and nature.

Most of the time, I read about things happenning around the globe or learn about interesting history, and as matter of fact I do search on brand-new/interesting technology.  
I do watch informative Youtube videos, tv-shows depicting real life or at least telling a considerably good story, podcasts.

In 2019, I started a Youtube channel to explain about Kubernetes technology for people who cannot find an easy-to-understand resources to learn. It attacted many organic subscribers and I am happy that I helped this many people to understand what Kubernetes is all about.  I cannot maintain it for a long time, but I am happy that viewers liked it and it provided a good kickstart for the ones trying to understand that particular technology.

When I get bored, I usually find myself starting a new hobby project or creating some content or writing a song. Corona pandemic affected everyone's life all around the world and pushed me to create a podcast to discuss, to connect with people that I already know or I lately met. Rota Hollanda was the outcome of that boredom and it was so good that I saw unexpected listen counts from people all over the world. I will keep on connecting and sharing people's stories on this podcast.

If I was not an engineer, I would like to make music for a living. Sometimes I try to record some tunes in diverse music genres, practicing music theory and see where the notes would take me. If you wonder my recordings, please check my soundcloud page üéµ
