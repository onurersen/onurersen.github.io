While learning English language, practicing via writing every word I learned again and again was the main exercise. English was a completely new language and words were so strange at first. Making it hard to remember how to write and spell as a matter of fact.
I still have my old notebooks having hundreds of pages with words written 10s of times :)

I was so naive to think that it was just for memorizing. 

When we started reading books in English following years, it was time to use those 10 times written words. It turned out that homework was done for creating a layer of knowledge, to make it easier to understand those books.

Everything in life looks like putting bricks and then building blocks on top.

I believe that if we ever stop learning, we stop adopting and then we die. Unlimited learning and collaboration capability are those make us Homo Sapiens, those help us survive. Yuval Noah Harari mentions this in his book Sapiens - undeniable importance of collaboration and learning as a group. 

Learning is like putting the next brick over the top of the previous one. As we learn, we discover new connections between old and new things. Regarding that, discovering and building new connections in terms of technology is what we can name innovation. 
Every breakthrough in technology is bound with the next big creation coming up. 

Could there be an app called Whatsapp if Apple did not create notifications? 

Could it be possible to contact people living on the other side of the world if there was no high-speed Internet?

Even if Tim Berners-Lee did not create www, could I be publishing this post?

In 2015, I was in a group of employees to have leadership training.

Frankly, I don't like having personal development classes because I believe those are for re-establishing the connection between the company and employees who lost their faith in the job they are doing. 

..but I admit that it was one of the best classes I've attended throughout my career.
We were shown how the human brain works, how to use techniques to communicate and negotiate and how to suppress bias by practicing. Repeating same action thousands and thousands of times makes neurons in your brain to connect to enable faster signal processing. 

They wire together and get ready to fire together.

That was the time I learned repetitive actions could be your reality both positively and negatively.

Negatively, you can behave like a person you'd never want to be - without realizing you discriminate people or genders. 

Positively, you can become a hero from zero by practicing technology.
