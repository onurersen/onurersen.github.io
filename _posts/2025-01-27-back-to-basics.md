It has been a long time since I logged something here. Not to my surprise, even even the framework that I used on Github was outdated so I was unable to push something to its repository.
  
A lot has happened during these years. I have been working and living in the Netherlands for five wonderful years now.
  
Some highlights to review those five years: 
  
* I decided to change where I live in Amsterdam, moved to my own apartment.
* I change the team and also my role in the company that I work for. 
* I created a brand-new music band, had a gig in Rotterdam, and next gig is in Amsterdam.
* I had a trip to Italian Alps, And a fantastic bicycle climb up to a place called Rittner Hoorn.
* I visited Madrid, And then went to Lisbon having two wonderful holidays in two weeks time, with unforgettable memories.
* I want to Japan to celebrate my fifth year in this country, had fantastic time there making new friends, and seeing a whole different world.

I tried creating YouTube channels, making voice memos, getting back to Instagram even. Actually, nothing How to feel myself fulfilled like I wrote something and put it right here. Honestly, I don't know but writing maybe the best form of expressing oneself in any communication channel. At least for me, it is like that.
  
I decided to visit this blog to put more up-to-date information about my experiences. Every day, we learn something new and just throw them two of our heads. So, long story short, this place will be back of my head from now on.
