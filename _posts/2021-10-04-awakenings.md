Last week I watched a 90s movie (based on a true story) named "Awakenings" which had two big stars in top cast; Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. 
I realized how long it had been since last time I watched a movie or a production that made me think about it this deep.

From cast to story telling, it was a wonderful movie. It reminded me once again that everything depends on our consciousness. Our social potential, ideas, interactions, soft skills, hard skills and everything we can imagine. Most important of all, **our uniqueness** is hidden behind our consciousness.  

Think that you are the one who wakes up (or comes back regarding movie) after 30 years of being away mentally. The world changes in a tremendous speed, I am not even sure if I would go crazy or not if I sleep and wake up 30 years later. I'm sure that I would be very very sad not witnessing the process that made societies and technology evolve all those  time.

I definitely emphatised Dr Sayer's (Robin Williams) hope and hopelessness. His excitement of finding a drug that can help and then his belief that it will work somehow again is something most of us can relate to. A drug (a chemical substance) helps and then you find yourself waiting a solution from chemistry. You want technology evolve so fast that it can catch up on before it is too late. When I tell this, it reminds me Christopher Reeve (Superman) waiting for upcoming medical studies to cure his spinal cord injury.

Leonard character in the movie which was perfectly portrayed by Robert De Niro is supposed to be  a wake up call for the viewers of this masterpiece. We work hard and play hard, try to satisfy ourselves via heavily getting connected to things those put us away from our own life and loved ones.  
Jobs, titles, money, status...  

When we realize it is too late to create invaluable memories;  
our jobs,  
our titles,  
and everything become meaningless.
