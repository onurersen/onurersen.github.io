It's been about 4 years since the last time I have been on an island. I was in Tahiti in 2018, since then no particular off-the-mainland experience was on my plate - if I don't count Texel island visit in north-west of the Netherlands which did not make me feel different then being in the Netherlands at all.

Most of my holiday destinations were countries of big continents, like those in Europe, Latin America, Middle East etc. but I realized that I have much more fun when I visit an island, especially one that is far from the mainland.  
Maybe it is because there are boundaries for places that I can see so I know my limits, how far I can go.  
Maybe there were less people, less chaos around so I don't need to rush for visiting places.  
Maybe both.

In these terms, Gran Canaria was a fantastic destination that I visited lately. It was sort of mainland Spain tucked into a small land somewhere in the Pasific Ocean, and interestingly very very close to continent Africa. I knew that I was going to feel authenticity. In the end, I was amazed by the sceneries, landscapes, tropic weather and the island effect.

Basically, Gran Canaria has everything someone can need to work remotely. One crazy thing  about the island, if you are living and working in EU-zone, you have everything as if you are working from your home in your country of origin. You have unlimited communication because you are still on EU-zone, you can spend your money as free without caring about exchanging. (still SEPA zone)

Things above sounds perfect but still there are some questions, sacrifices as well.  Trade-offs...  

Very first question I have in my mind about living in such an island is whether I can keep my productivity for work at a certain level. There are lots of things to pump joy and excitement, lots of once-in-a-lifetime experiences around.  
Second question is whether it can be a sustainable living having natural limits. Being 21st century people, as a matter of fact, we cannot be crammed in a life within boundaries. On the island, exploration stops at one point. Let's say there is not a single beach that you haven't been or you did climb all the mountains, or you already have photo with all the landscapes...

I think keeping the dream of living and working in this glorious place is the best things for me to do.  
Who knows...  

Maybe someday I rent an Airbnb flat and taste living at Gran Canaria and working remotely from there a tiny bit.
