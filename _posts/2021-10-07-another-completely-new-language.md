English can stand as a difficult language for some people. Especially for people whose mother tongue is completely different than English. But for those who do not even have latin letters in their alphabet it can be damn hard. (I cannot even imagine)

People having Latin letters in their native alphabet are lucky at this point. They just skip the burden of how letters are pronounced. However, then comes the problem of sentence formation and exceptional cases. There, Google Translate can help up to a point. (i.e. Dutch)

After practicing English for 30-something years, I now set sail to learn Dutch. Previously in my 20s, I wanted to learn German and put serious effort to reach a point. My motivation eventually eroded and I was again at square #1.  Then I wanted to learn French - not aware that I was pushing the bar higher tough and nobody warned me ðŸ˜Š

I tried Michel Thomas method, listening his courses. They at first seem to be working but then I could not hold on to learning constantly, life happenned and again hello square #1.

One point is certain that you have to expose yourself to the language as much as possible.
...and that is not possible if you live in the Netherlands or Nordic countries. People can speak native-level English and don't bother to switch to English just in case you don't understand what they say.

I wish that I was trapped in an island with people who know only Dutch ðŸ˜Š
It can sound utopic but that would create a super-duper environment to learn a tough language.
