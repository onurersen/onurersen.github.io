Every time our phone drops a call, we blame the carrier for an unstable network. Every time some good functionality on device 
saves our time, we thank our phone manufacturer.  
Every time we wait too much in the queue at the government office, we blame the officer for working slow. 
Every time, we finish things swiftly in the same office (off-chance), we thank the fast government systems.

Whenever we donâ€™t put our bias into perspective and analyze mindfully there we will be hopefully 
finding the right thing to blame... or maybe we realize there's nothing to blame.

How do you choose who to blame?
