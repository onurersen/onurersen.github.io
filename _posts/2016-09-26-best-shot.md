Famous entertainment systems' producer Nintendo was a playing card producer once - Not only a playing card producer.  They tried to address diverse sectors by opening hotels, taxi companies etc. Then in 1975, Nintendo moved to the video game industry.

You will remember the famous Duck Hunt game created by Nintendo in 1984.

Duck Hunt game is played using a plastic pointer gun(zapper gun) connected to console - making you shoot the ducks flying on the TV screen.

The idea behind is simple:

Zapper gun consists of 2 things - a trigger and a photodiode (light sensor). You pull the trigger, this makes TV screen go completely black for one frame. Instantly, making light sensor start working to sample the black color from your TV screen. In the next frame, the game flashes a solid white block around the targets you’re supposed to be shooting at, with the rest remaining black. The game knows which target is hit by which frame is currently being shown when a light shift from black to white is detected. And when it detects...

BOOM! 

You shot the duck.

Think about an era no smart televisions or touch screens exist...Nintendo created this shooter game interacting with an interface(CRT TV).

Well..actually a household not designed for gaming.

Let me name this system a "Workaround". A workaround to innovate over existing devices. Like innovative solutions those we try to find when we hit problems in our projects, in our daily lives.

We can't stop.

Inability to proceed does not mean that we're done.

We use technology, we use what we previously have to take the best shot. We cannot wait for new materials, new discoveries on earth to be made.

Technology is the biggest workaround.
Technology is the way of making possible what we think impossible. Even, has it in the definition: "the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems".

Let me close up with a legend's words on impossible things:

> Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they’ve been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It’s an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It’s a dare. Impossible is potential. 
> Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.
