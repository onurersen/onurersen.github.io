I have been feeling Waste-of-Time trauma for some time and I think there are many people who also experience this.  
When you hear people labeling activities like nonsense, not need it, waste of time, keep in mind that they shall not have the luxury of manipulating you about what makes you feel good.

With too many distractions in our lives, it is impossible to be caught with WoT feeling. As modern-day workers, we are constantly being pushed to check some boxes, improve ourselves, keep up with the latest technology and trend, monitor social media, take care of ourselves and our loved ones, and million more things to be done.  

Being so much overloaded with lots of responsibilities and many bars to raise for ourselves, we can filter activities making no-sense. In an extreme level, spending time on streaming platforms, playing video games, cooking, reading books, all become meaningless and waste of time.  

As an example, sometime ago I started to feel that my PlayStation 4 was the most useless device that I have at home. Why? Because it was wasting my time playing video games every now and then. On the flipside, I remember last year playing and enjoying games like God of War, Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty etc.  

Moreover, I choose to cook really simple dishes using my air fryer, preferred ready to consume packaged food that I buy from the supermarket. Why? Because it was waste of time to cook complex dishes, those in the end will be helping to cope with my hunger.  

It became such disturbing for me to give up on most of the things that I enjoy, that may add fun into my life...  

So I stopped and change my mind on labeling things like "waste of time" and "makes sense to do".

More than often, time feels like slipping away. Sometimes about time, you have the feeling of a commodity that you need to trade with good reason. In other words, thinking that we only live once, one can think that we have to use our time for the very important things.  
The truth is whatever you do or wherever you go, you will be wasting huge amount of your time while commuting, cooking, walking, sitting, chatting, doing anything.  

Time spent could be meaningful when you enjoy it, when you are aware of what you're doing and especially if you really want to do it. Lately I switched my mindset of thinking that "doing anything with free will and desire cannot be categorized as waste of time".  

I now believe that watching my favorite TV show or playing my favorite game on PlayStation will never be a waste of time.  
It is your personal choice and you shall not be judging yourself doing it.  
If you enjoy it, if you're having fun whenever you feel like doing it, just do it.  

Sometimes we absolutely need to waste our time. For our minds to relax, for our perspectives to change.
