About 5 years ago, I bought my Marshall Major headphones while I was working in Sweden.
It was a good deal for such a country with challenging weather conditions, keeping my ears warm and providing above average music quality.

I used it for recording and sometimes while working. Once, tried to run on a treadmill with those 
headphones and end of the session my ears were as hot as hell :) I gave up using it outdoor.

Many things changed in terms of connectivity technologies since then. When I was back in my home town, 
I bought tiny headphones comparing with Marshall headphones, those supporting Bluetooth 4.0. 
Working without cables, even doing fitness and running cordless was an outstanding experience.

After that, I felt that I don't like to see too many cables around. Whenever I see a cable on my desk, I try to hide them
 under the desk, behind the monitor :)

And there it was the time when Beats by Dre headphones overwhelmed headphone market and streets. I admit, 
I bought a cheaper alternative to Beats by Dre but I was satisfied with it. Frequency range was fair enough, earpads were isolating exterior sounds, what would I
need more? 

Recently, I came up with a Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgEjI5PZa78) supporting I was not wrong with my choice. 

When I watched this video, I considered changing earpads with the new ones I bought from Aliexpress. I will go with my Major headphones 
until someday a breakthrough headphone technology will come to dominate the market - at that time also, I will try to find a cheap alternative :)

As that video supports and everybody knows, human ears are eligible to hear a constant frequency range (20Hz-20KHz). We cannot hear outside that zone.
Ok, we can feel maybe or some people can feel at least outside that frequency but in general, everybody is fine with 20Hz-20KHz :)
