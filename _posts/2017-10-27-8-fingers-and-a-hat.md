Most of us will remember Chaplin. Especially while talking about black&white silent film era.  
...but there was another man who made movies still worth watching.  
He made around 200 movies in his whole career.  
During the shooting of a movie, a real bomb exploded in his hand, causing him to lose two fingers, a burned face 
and damaged eyesight. It took months to recover and continue with the film. After that incident, he played with a 
prosthetic glove having artificial fingers for his missing ones. In most movies, it was hard to notice one of his hands was fake.

He was a commercial success, a low-profile actor and making more money than Charlie Chaplin.

Then he shot a movie which became a cult with the screenplay and breathtaking scenes.

All stunts played by himself.

[Safety Last!(1923)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEcTjhUN_7U) is still fun to watch. Dangerous scenes in the movie made people discuss for years on how they were shot.

The story of Harold Lloyd(1893-1971) is a good example of how misfortune could not beat creativity inside.
