Being unique species we humans are programmed to say "Yes". But saying "Yes" all the time can become the mother of all evil for us. There is even quite a few movies on the subject. Jim Carrey's "Yes Man" for example.  

It's OK if you say "No" most of the time – but clear,understandable and kind away.
People are going to respect you even more when you provide them a concrete message, a straightforward answer. But if you say "Yes" and then you do not comply with what you say, you lose their trust. More to that, there is a worse third option that is keeping the people waiting on the line, neither responding "Yes" nor "No" that causes loss of trust, respect and connection.
And if someone close does not accept your "No", most probably that person does not come out to be a true friend.

- I’m flattered you considered me, but unfortunately I’ll have to pass this time.
- Sounds great, but I can’t commit.
- You’re so kind to think of me, but I can’t.
