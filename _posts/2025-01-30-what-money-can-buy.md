Lately, I get Influence by the things that I see, the things that people recommend, the things that people who accept as authority and advice.
I feel like I am being influenced by the modern world. 
  

To be honest, social media and all this marketing things Make people buy things that they don't really need.
"Needs and Wants", right... Nowadays we cannot distinguish between these two, many thanks to a lot of information being pushed over us, however Everything and 
everyone tries to pull us to the orbit of "Wants".

I generally avoid buying stuff that won't change in my life in a positive way. Around 2019, I bought DJI Osmo Mobile. Gimbal world for Youtubers, 
broadcaster was booming. 
Since mobile phones were also enhancing in video recording technology, I wanted get into wagon to produce something remarkable. Indeed, I had no 
idea what the gimbal was at that time and one day a colleague gave his brand new shiny DJI Osmo Mobile to me to test for the weekend. I was amazed by the 
possibilities of shooting videos and being creative with that device. As a matter of fact, ordered mine right away. At first it was super fun to shoot videos 
using my mobile phone mounted on that gimbal. Later, it became a burden to carry the gimbal, mount it, calibrate it etc.

Also DJI released new more capable versions of it and I ended up preferring not to carry it with me instead use my barehands to shoot interesting videos. I later somehow sold it and promised myself
 not to buy another technological device that I really want, but I really need.
  
We are humans, and humans can make the very same mistake again and again...
  
Recently, I was listening to Andrew Huberman's podcast. In an episode, he was talking about sleep quality and improve effectiveness of the sleep. 
His speech at one moment went around Wake-up lights. He told that he found them useful, since he was behind the idea of getting natural or artifical light 
somehow during the very first moments when people wake-up. This way, people can activate their eye nerves and get morning boost to feel beter and perform better. 
Of course, I did search and ordered mine in a few days. I was not capable of evaluating if it was a "Need" or a "Want". 
  
For sure, I was struggling waking up in the morning, because I live in a country which is dark long in the mornings, especially during autumn and winter days. 
First ridiculous thing I bumped into was super-high prices from Philips for a Wake-up light. More than 100 even close 200 euro for a simple light with a timer 
and slowly dimming light functionality??? while even it is super-cheap LED lighting technology??? 
I was really curious about who did valuation of this non-advanced technology/product, and how...
In the end, I bought a cheap device that I can use for its sole purpose.
  
In the morning of the very next day that I bought my Wake-Up light, I woke up 30 mins before it started to shine and its alarm went off. And then same 
thing happennd on the other day and then another day... It was long that after I realized that I paid for the Wake-Up light to motivate 
my inner clock to wake up automatically early.

I think sometimes we pay the price not for only the physical goods but to stimulate ourselves to realize that we don't actually need something but the effect of having it.
Owning a gimbal made me realize that I do not need a gimbal, everything around recording a video is possible without a gimbal and then owning a Wake-Up light made me realize that as long as 
I can wake up without a Wake-Up light - but anyway still I need that artificial lighting that it provides in the mornings, says Mr Huberman :)
